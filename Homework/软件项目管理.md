### Q1: Describe the advantages and disadvantages of remote collaboration in software development.        

advantages:

- Help in maintaining balance between work and private  life of the workers. 

- Help in improving the productivity of the  teams along with finding new opportunities without any consideration of  their location.

- Increase productivity by accessing wider range of talent away from workers' mainland. 

- Increase business without  spending more on commuting their local workforce to remote locations.

disadvantages:

- It can be difficult to remain connected, brainstorming, resolve  problems and improving the profits of the business unless the team  connected to a project work in the same building or ground. 

- The Collective Knowledge doesn’t Disseminate. In a typical, centralized company, knowledge spreads like a virus. The problem is that knowledge is mostly stored in private conversations.

- Distraction. If you have a family, this doesn’t count phone calls from your wife,  your kids busting into the office when they get home from school, or  playing chauffeur. Distractions happen. And unfortunately, they can be hard to prevent.

- Can't “Turn Off” Work. At the end of the day, a typical office worker checks out at 6PM, drives home to his or her family and spends the evening doing some leisure  activity. People need a way to differentiate between being “at work” and “at home”.
