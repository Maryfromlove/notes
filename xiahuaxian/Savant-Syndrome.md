## **Savant syndrome**



**Savant syndrome**,  rare condition wherein a person of less than normal [intelligence](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-intelligence-psychology) or severely limited [emotional](https://www.britannica.com/science/emotion) range has prodigious [intellectual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual) gifts in a specific area. Mathematical, musical, artistic, and  mechanical abilities have been among the talents demonstrated by [savants](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/savants). Examples include performing rapid mental calculations of huge sums, playing lengthy musical [compositions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compositions) from [memory](https://www.britannica.com/science/memory-psychology) after a single hearing, and repairing complex mechanisms without training. About 10 percent of [autistic](https://www.britannica.com/science/autism) people exhibit [savant](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/savant) syndrome and are known as autistic savants. Non-autistic [intellectually disabled](https://www.britannica.com/science/intellectual-disability) people may also be savants, though the incidence among them is much lower.
